# DATA PROCESSING SCRIPT.
This is a simple Python script that loops through TEXT ('.txt') files in a provided folder, extracts the text and labels if it's either, NEGATIVE or POSITIVE sentiment and saves it in a newly created CSV file in the specified path.


## Why Did I Write This Script?
I was working on a Data Science & Machine Learning project where the goal was to classify movie reviews sentiments as either POSITIVE or NEGATIVE, however, the dataset provided contained the individual reviews in a TXT file and saved in a 'pos' and 'neg' folders. The 'pos' folder contained TXT files of POSITIVE reviews and the 'neg' folder contained the NEGATIVE TXT files moview reviews.

Instead of working with individual TXT files since it makes it complicated to work with them on Jupyter, I decided to write this script that loops through every TXT file in the respective folder(s), extract the text content in the TXT file, create a new CSV file and save the content inside the newly created CSV file with a labeled feature of either POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.


## What Did I Learn From Working On This Script?
- I learned how to clean data.
- Opening, creating and editing files using Python.
- OOP in Python.
- Also, I learned that when working on any Data Science, Machine Learning or AI project, remember, the dataset doesn't always come in the desired form. Most of the times you'll have to wrangle, clean and structure to your desired form, manually!


## What Tools & Technologies Did I Use?
1. Python 3.5.2
2. VS Code (Obviously! Well... almost!!!)
3. ChatGPT 3
4. Git
5. My MacBook Pro. LOL!!!
